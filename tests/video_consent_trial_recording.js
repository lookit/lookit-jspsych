  purpose:
    "Why do babies love cats? This study will help us find out whether babies love cats because of their soft fur or their twitchy tails.",
  procedures:
    "Your child will be shown pictures of lots of different cats, along with noises that cats make like meowing and purring. We are interested in which pictures and sounds make your child smile. We will ask you (the parent) to turn around to avoid influencing your child's responses.",
  risk_statement:
    "There are no expected risks if you participate in the study. (This is optional, but should typically be included. If you leave it out there's no 'risks' section and you should include risk information elsewhere.)",
  voluntary_participation:
    "There are two sessions in this study; you will be invited to complete another session next month. It is okay not to do both sessions! (This is optional; leave it out if you don't need to say anything besides participation in this session being voluntary.)",
  payment:
    "After you finish the study, we will email you a $5 BabyStore gift card within approximately three days. To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but we hope you will enjoy the experience.",
  datause:
    "We are primarily interested in your child's emotional reactions to the images and sounds. A research assistant will watch your video to measure the precise amount of delight in your child's face as he or she sees each cat picture.",
  include_databrary: true,
  additional_video_privacy_statement:
    "We will also ask your permission to use your videos as stimuli for other parents. (This is optional; leave it out if there aren't additional ways you'll share video beyond as described in the participant's video privacy level and Databrary selections.)",
