# CHS Custom jsPsych Plugins And Extensions

This documentation will provide explanations and use cases for the packages written by CHS for the jsPsych experiment runner.

If you're just starting out, a great place to start would be with [jsPsych's documentation]({{ jsPsych }}). It's well written and will provide the majority of what one would need to know to create an experiment.

## Developer Documentation

Documentation for developers can be found in the [REAME](https://github.com/lookit/lookit-jspsych) for the monorepo.
